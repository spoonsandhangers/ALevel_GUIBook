"""
labels can contain images as well as text.
images must first be assigned to a variable in tkinter before they can be used.
To do this a photoimage is created.
We can store all the images in the same folder as our python files, but this some becomes
crowded if we are building a large application.
As each operating system has a different way of referencing the path to a file e.g.
windows: c:\users\sarah\documents\pythonfiles
mac /users/sarah/documents/pythonfiles
it is good practice to first find the path to the python folder you are using and then
to set the path to a separate folder containing the images.  Then no matter what operating system is
being used the path is still valid and you can store your images in a folder.
This code combines a label a button and a drop down list.
Both text and an image are added to the label.
